Part 1

This essay is aimed to access the pros and cons of GUI vs Command line generated maps and review the generation of two maps.

The shapefile used in Arcmap and R studio is generated from UK Data Service geography service(Welsh Unitary Authorities, 2001). The aggregate data about economic activity of British and Chinese comes from the InFuse 2001 census data. However it is hard to compare two groups because the comparison needs the ratio of British people in Total British People and the data doesn't contain the number of total British to calculate. The UK data service provides not only boundary data but also attribute data, which is really convenient to add the attribute data to the variables. The map illustrate the economic activity of British and Chinese in Wales.

In the Arcmap, I used two layers to make two maps which show different attribute data and enable to show in which area two groups are more economically active. The classification method is Natural Breaks which is most suitable to make clear categories in this case. The location of wales in UK is shown by using 'selsect by location' tool and export a new layer. Additionally, it's convenient to insert the legend, title and north arrow in the layout view, while in R, it's complex to adjust the position of such properties.

In R studio, it takes only several lines to plot the map except loading the packages, however it takes some time to learn the usage and argument. Additionally, there should be no typing error or format error in R studio. Firstly, I read the shapefile and data into the R, and then append the csv data into the map attribute data. Finally, I use plot function to plot map. In plot function, it could be seen that the code is complex. For example, the codes of style and palette are specified and they are difficult to remember, and it's time-consuming to change the field name from space to '.'

From my perspective, both GUI(like Arcmap) and Command line generated maps(like R studio) have benefits and drawbacks. Firstly, the command line interface (CLI) is more difficult than graphical user interface (GUI) for the beginners. It takes a little time to use tools to make the map in Arcmap, While it's necessary to spend a lot of time learning the code and different methods by using '?' in R studio. Besides, a number of packages are premises to use one tool and they always need to be updated. Any error could cause a failure and some time the system may fail down if the steps are wrong. In conclusion, the command line interface seems like creating the map, while the GUI is using the tools to edit the shapefile. 

Secondly, the command line interface takes less system resource than GUI. The R generated map takes 88 kb, while the Arcmap generated map takes 279 kb and the arcmap file is much bigger. Thirdly, the CLI runs faster than GUI. In Arcmap, it's really slow to present the map when zooming in or out especially a large shapefile in it.
